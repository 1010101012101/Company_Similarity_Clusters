Axonia Medical
	Developer of tissue-engineered medical products for peripheral & central nervous system injury. The company produces living, functional tissue-engineered nerve grafts in the lab that can replace and repair damaged parts of the nervous system. It has developed technique for production of axons (instead of stem cells), the long thin parts of nerve cells that carry signals to distant target cells. Its regenerative treatments use neurons from patients or cadavers to grow long, integrated tracks of axons in the lab and then implants this tissue into the body, which then enables or accelerates the bodyâ€™s natural repair system.
