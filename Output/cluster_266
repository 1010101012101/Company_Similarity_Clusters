Cephalon
	Cephalon, Inc. is an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative products in four core therapeutic areas: central nervous system, pain, oncology and inflammatory disease. In addition to conducting an active research and development program, the Company markets seven proprietary products in the United States and numerous products in various countries throughout Europe and the world. The Company\'s most significant products are wakefulness products, PROVIGIL(r) (modafinil) Tablets and NUVIGIL(r) (armodafinil) Tablets. The Company\'s Central Nervous System disorders portfolio includes three FDA-approved and marketed products: NUVIGIL, for improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, OSA/HS and SWSD; PROVIGIL, for the same labeled indications as NUVIGIL; and GABITRIL, for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in epileptic patients. PROVIGIL improves wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, and the Company has launched the product in the United States. GABITRIL is a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid, reuptake inhibitor approved for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in epileptic patients. The Company\'s pain therapeutics portfolio currently includes four marketed products in the United States. It markets AMRIX, a once-a-day, extended-release version of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in the brand FLEXERIL(r). AMRIX is indicated for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The Company also market three products, FENTORA, ACTIQ, and generic OTFC, which focus on treating breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients. FENTORA is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ACTIQ is approved in the United States for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients. The Company\'s U.S. oncology portfolio includes two marketed products to treat patients with hematologic cancers: TREANDA, a bi-functional hybrid cytotoxic; and TRISENOX(r), an intravenous arsenic-based targeted therapy currently marketed in the U.S., as well as in Europe. TREANDA is a novel hybrid cytotoxic alkylating agent that differs from conventional compounds in its apparent multi-functional mechanism of action. In addition to killing cells by damaging their DNA and triggering apoptosis-which is typical of alkylating agents-researchers demonstrated that TREANDA also causes the disruption of cell division. Bendamustine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in TREANDA, is currently marketed in Germany by a third party for the treatment of NHL, CLL, multiple myeloma, metastatic breast cancer and other solid tumors. TRISENOX was approved for marketing in the United States and Europe in 2000 and 2002, respectively, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia, a life threatening hematologic cancer. The Company markets and sells directly or through partnerships 30 different branded products in over 50 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and have a strong presence in the five key European pharmaceutical markets: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and affiliates in Benelux and Poland. The Company faces intense competition and rapid technological change in the pharmaceutical marketplace.
