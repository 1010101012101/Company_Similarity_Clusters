Aderis Pharmaceuticals
	Developer of therapeutics focused on cardiovascular, renal and neurological diseases. The company develops novel small-molecule, receptor-specific therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system, cardiovascular and renal diseases. The company focuses on drug candidates that act selectively to either block (antagonists) or increase (agonists) the activity of certain proteins, such as adenosine or dopamine, to produce the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects. Small molecules generally offer the dosing flexibility required for patients to easily take the drug as prescribed (commonly referred to as patient compliance), have a broader array of dosage forms, lend themselves to easier formulation and have greater potential for absorption and utilization by the body.

Axonia Medical
	Developer of tissue-engineered medical products for peripheral & central nervous system injury. The company produces living, functional tissue-engineered nerve grafts in the lab that can replace and repair damaged parts of the nervous system. It has developed technique for production of axons (instead of stem cells), the long thin parts of nerve cells that carry signals to distant target cells. Its regenerative treatments use neurons from patients or cadavers to grow long, integrated tracks of axons in the lab and then implants this tissue into the body, which then enables or accelerates the bodyâ€™s natural repair system.
