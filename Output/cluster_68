Aderis Pharmaceuticals
	Developer of therapeutics focused on cardiovascular, renal and neurological diseases. The company develops novel small-molecule, receptor-specific therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system, cardiovascular and renal diseases. The company focuses on drug candidates that act selectively to either block (antagonists) or increase (agonists) the activity of certain proteins, such as adenosine or dopamine, to produce the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects. Small molecules generally offer the dosing flexibility required for patients to easily take the drug as prescribed (commonly referred to as patient compliance), have a broader array of dosage forms, lend themselves to easier formulation and have greater potential for absorption and utilization by the body.
