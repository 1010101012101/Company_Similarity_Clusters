Ballard Power Systems
	Ballard Power Systems Inc was incorporated in the State of Canada on November 12, 2008. It is a clean energy growth company. The company is engaged in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell development and commercialization. The Company\'s main business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of fuel cell products for a variety of applications, focusing on motive power (material handling and buses) and stationary power (back-up power, supplemental power, and distributed generation). A fuel cell is an environmentally clean electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the air) to produce electricity. Ballard fuel cell products feature high fuel efficiency, low operating temperature, low noise and vibration, compact size, quick response to changes in electrical demand, modular design and environmental cleanliness. The Company has four principal subsidiaries and affiliates: Ballard Fuel Cell Systems Inc., an Oregon corporation that develops methanol-fueled clean energy backup power systems; Dantherm Power A/S ("Dantherm Power"), a Denmark-based corporation jointly owned with Dantherm A/S that develops hydrogen-fueled clean energy backup power systems; BDF IP Holdings Ltd. ("IP Holdings"), a Canadian corporation that holds intellectual property assets; and Ballard Material Products Inc., a Delaware corporation that formerly developed and manufactured carbon fiber products for use in the automotive and fuel cell markets, and which now focuses on the development of fuel processing components and systems for use in fuel cell applications.
